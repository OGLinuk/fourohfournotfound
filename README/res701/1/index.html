			<p>Today in class the tutor had a set of questions that he wanted us to break up into groups and answer. Reflecting on these questions has only increased the amount questions rather than provide truthful or even a slightly understandable answers. In saying that they are also extremely interesting questions that have a much deeper meaning than anyone could ever percieve or come to understand. These are the answers that resulted after refined discussion internally and with the group I was with.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-difference-between-knowing-something-and-having-knowledge-of-something">Is there a difference between ‘knowing’ something and ‘having knowledge’ of something?</h2>
<p>Yes, knowing is something that one believes to be true, and knowledge is a belief that a known holds true.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-truth">What is ‘truth’?</h2>
<p><strong><em>A truth is a known belief</em></strong>, but that just spawns more questions like <em>what does one believe to be known?</em> <em>How can one know for absolute fact what is believed?</em> <em>How does the first come to know a belief?</em></p>
<pre><code>No one is the only one who can know where words first 
truly came from, because no one is the only one who could
know which one said what first. 
                        ~ one who first said what</code></pre>
<p>This quote is an example of something I believe to be truth(ful), based on deductive reasoning. By that I mean this quote, although highly ambigous, through logical conclusion(s) can actually be proven true. One can deduce that if that if <em>no one can know where words first truly come from</em>, <em>someone must know or come to know</em>. If one believes the previous, then one can deduce that <em>no one is the only one who could know which one said what first</em> because <em>which one would be the one to “hear” or come to know ones first word what?</em> If the previous is believed, then one can finally deduce that the one who <em>must</em> have been the one “saying” or coming to know the quote was <em>one who said what first</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-do-we-really-mean-when-we-say-something-is-true">What do we really mean when we say something is ‘true’?</h2>
<p>It has been researched or experienced and continues to hold true. Death is the easiest example, although one of the hardest to understand (entirely). <strong><em>Everyone</em></strong> knows or comes to know death one way or another and <em>everytime</em> the true remains the same about a few things.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Death is final</p></li>
<li><p>Death comes for <strong><em>everyone</em></strong></p></li>
<li><p>No one can ever escape death</p></li>
<li><p>Death can come at <strong><em>any</em></strong> moment</p></li>
</ol>
<p>These are only a couple examples, I am encourage you to think of more.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-difference-between-knowing-something-is-true-and-believing-that-something-is-true">Is there a difference between knowing something is ‘true’ and believing that something is ‘true’?</h2>
<p>Yes. Knowing is experiencing a truth, where as believing is perceiving a truth. To yourself knowing and believing are the same, but to outside, knowing is something that <em>holds</em> true and believing something that <em>can be</em> true or not.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-difference-between-subjective-and-objective-truth">What is the difference between subjective and objective ‘truth’?</h2>
<p>Subjective truth is determined by an individual, since everyone forms an outcome in a different way, where as objective truth is a truth that is true or false and cannot be inferred.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-fact-and-can-facts-change">What is a ‘fact’ and can ‘facts’ change ?</h2>
<p>A fact is a truth that remains to be true regardless of the number of times it is tested/experienced. Yes facts can change, because facts can be proven wrong due to new knowns or unknowns.</p>
<h2 id="how-do-we-discover-if-something-is-true-or-not">How do we discover if something is ‘true’ or not?</h2>
<p>Repetition of the truth until proven untrue. Something can <em>hold</em> true, but could never not be proven wrong. Take for example the statement “I am funny.” This is a statment that <em>I</em> percieve to be true. Then I am asked to tell a joke and reply “there is no place like 127.0.0.1”. Does this statement hold true in <em>your</em> perception? Lets say you thought that joke was funny, this means that the statement <em>holds true</em>. Now lets say you didnt think my joke was funny, this means that the statement is <em>no longer true</em>. That is my perception of how one discovers if something is true.</p>
<h2 id="we-do-not-see-things-as-they-are-but-as-we-are-anais-nin.-what-does-this-mean">“We do not see things as they are but as we are” Anais Nin. What does this mean?</h2>
<p>To me I think that this quote means that we percieve things individually, and so we do not ever truly see things <em>as they are</em>, but as <em>we percieve them to be</em>.</p>
<h2 id="reality-is-an-illusion-albeit-a-very-persistent-one-einstein.-what-does-this-mean">“Reality is an illusion, albeit a very persistent one” Einstein. What does this mean?</h2>
<p>Reality is continual perception formed by ones knowing and the knowledge of others.</p>
<h2 id="is-there-a-difference-between-true-and-valid-explain">Is there a difference between ‘true’ and ‘valid’? Explain!</h2>
<p>Yes, something that is true can be proven wrong. Validity is a conclusion drawn from truths that cannot be proven. Lets take the funny example again. Lets assume that we both believe that I am funny. From this truth we can percieve that the next person would also believe me to be funny/not funny. We cannot ourselves determine whether the conclusions are true, we can only continue percieving it to be valid until otherwise.</p>
<p>/</p>
<p>The next set of questions are homework which are the following …</p>
<h2 id="what-is-ontology-how-is-it-relevant-to-research">What is ontology? How is it relevant to research?</h2>
<p>Ontology is a question that branches from <em>metaphysics</em> which concerns the study of being, existence, reality, and others. “Ontology is the assumptions we make about the kind and nature of reality and what exists.” Snape and Spencer (2003)</p>
<p>Personally I believe its relevance to research is to define <em>what it is</em> being studied. How can one study about something one does not know about? One must first <em>know</em> about what it is one wants to <em>know more</em> or <em>come to understand better</em> something which they know <em>little of</em>. How one <em>first</em> comes to know may not have an answer (or a simple one). Lets take an epiphany as an example and a thought experiement of who first came to know about <em>space</em>.</p>
<p>This might be arbitrary, but there is a great example on the wiki of epiphany which is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flammarion_engraving"><strong><em>Flammarion engraving. From “L’atmosphère”, book of 1888</em></strong></a>. Though one cant say how the one who made <em>L’atmosphère</em> came to understand there was something out beyond the edges of our earth, one <em>can</em> say that they <em>did know</em> about the stars and the sun (perhaps we could safely assume the moon as well). That means they could come to understand <em>space</em> even though it wasnt tangible or accessible. We also know <em>now</em> that there is in fact something out beyong the edges of our earth; <em>the sun. the stars. space, and more (neutron stars, blackholes, ect…)</em>.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-epistemology-how-is-it-relevant-to-research">What is epistemology? How is it relevant to research?</h2>
<p>Epistemology is the study around <em>knowledge</em> or one <em>coming to know</em>. The example above could be thought as knowledge that was realized through previous knowledge. This can be safely assumed because one had <em>knowledge</em> of the stars and thes sun since one included it in the engraving.</p>
<p>I believe that its relevance is similar to ontology, but the difference is rather than define <em>what it is</em>, epistemology addresses <em>what it is not</em>. Why is it important to understand what something is not? If one comes to know something that is not, then one has come to know <em>of a thing</em>. Meaning they <em>came to knowledge of something</em> (perhaps also <em>something that is not a thing</em>).</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-connection-between-ontology-and-epistemology-in-a-research-context">What is the connection between ontology and epistemology in a research context?</h2>
<p>Both ontology and epistemology are <em>required</em> in order for one to “study” something. In order for one to study something, one must first know or have knowledge of the <em>something</em>. Knowing doesn’t necessarily mean <em>absolute knowledge</em> of something, in fact one can never absolutely know something for certain. So it is from what is known and the knowledge around what is, that serves as a foundation for research.</p>
