			<p>Today’s blog is about finding two academic research papers of my choice, which as stated in the <a href="/post/res701-0">first res701 blog</a> will be around data science, machine learning, or deep learning. I stumbled across a gentleman by the name of <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/">Jürgen Schmidhuber</a> when watching a video on a panel of specialists talking about the current state of AI. At the time I had no clue who he was or what his accomplishments were, but came to know that he was behind the publication of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory">LSTM</a> (long short-term memory) architectures and also the advancements in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network">CNN</a> (convolutional neural networks) architectures. “Since age 15 or so, the main goal of professor Jürgen Schmidhuber has been to build a self-improving Artificial Intelligence (AI) smarter than himself, then retire.” <a href="http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/">[source]</a> These forms of AI are called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_machine"><em>Gödel machines</em></a>.</p>
<p>I have two primary interests in the fields of data science, machine learning, and deep learning. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning">Meta learning</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamodeling">metamodeling</a>. I do also have a fascination with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network">GANs</a> (generative adversarial networks), but thats because I hope to one day be able to procedurally generate shows like Rick &amp; Morty (shout out to Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon with the hope of letting me do so without infringing on copyright). Another reason I have a fascination with GANs is my suspicion that they can/will be used to generate <em>very</em> realistic incriminating data, which is ironic since the wiki has recently added a section at the bottom called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network#Concerns"><em>concerns</em></a>. I have had this theory since learning about GANs back in 2017, but the recent website <a href="https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/">‘this person does not exist’</a> has shown that this is indeed <em>possible</em>.</p>
<p>Enough doom and gloom though, time to get into the invigorating stuff! We dont actually have to <em>review</em> the papers that we choose, but rather answer a set of questions regarding the papers. The questions are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Title and author(s) of the article</p></li>
<li><p>APA reference</p></li>
<li><p>How you found the article and what keywords you used</p></li>
<li><p>What kind of article is it, (journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis…)</p></li>
<li><p>All the reasons that you think it is an academic article</p></li>
<li><p>How well it fits the ‘structure of an academic article’</p></li>
<li><p>How many references it has</p></li>
<li><p>How many citations it has (if you can find out)</p></li>
<li><p>For articles that you found online, the url of the article</p></li>
<li><p>Say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not w/ reasoning</p></li>
</ul>
<p><br />

<h4 id="title-and-authors">Title and author(s)</h4>
<p><em>Gödel Machines: Self-Referential Universal Problem Solvers Making Provably Optimal Self-Improvements</em></p>
<p>By <em>Jürgen Schmidhuber</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h4 id="apa-reference">APA reference</h4>
<p>“Schmidhuber, J. (2007). Gödel machines: Fully self-referential optimal universal self-improvers. In Artificial general intelligence (pp. 199-226). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg.”</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h4 id="how-you-found-the-article-and-what-keywords-you-used">How you found the article and what keywords you used</h4>
<p>I found the article via google scholar and the search used was <em>godel machine juergen schmidhuber</em></p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h4 id="what-kind-of-article-it-is">What kind of article it is?</h4>
<p>The article is an academic research paper</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<h4 id="all-the-reasons-that-you-think-it-is-an-academic-article">All the reasons that you think it is an academic article</h4>
<p>The primary reason I believe it is an academic article is because of where it is published (<a href="https://arxiv.org/">arXiv</a>). Most academic papers that I have come across have been published on arXiv, so I believe the site to be a credible source. Jürgen Schmidhuber is also the co-director of Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research, a research institution in Switzerland.</p>
