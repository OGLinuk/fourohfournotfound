			<p>Todays blog is around reviewing another classmates project proposal. There are quite a lot of good proposals, but the one that I have chosen to review is <a href="https://stewartmetcalfe.wordpress.com/2019/05/09/week-8-brainstorming-the-project/">Stewart’s project proposal</a>. His proposal is about <em>building a neural network to recognize and classify a face in an image</em>. The activities he has listed are as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Read an academic article on face detection</li>
<li>Research computer vision and find relevant articles</li>
<li>Research academic articles on computer vision</li>
<li>Lynda courses
<ul>
<li>Neural networks and convolutional neural networks essential training</li>
<li>Deep learning: face recognition</li>
<li>Classify images and detect recognition</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CourseRA tutorials
<ul>
<li>Convolutional neural networks</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Exploring and using Azure’s cloud based face or computer vision services</li>
</ul>
<p>As I have a bias for AI, I like this proposal and am glad to see a classmate interested in it. There are a couple of things that I would suggest as additional activities. The first is deciding which language/framework/library he is going to use for the project. There are a number of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_deep-learning_software">deep learning frameworks/libraries</a> which can be used, and all are written in different languages. My second suggestion for an activity would be to find examples of computer vision projects which he can use to draw ideas or information from. My third suggestion for an activity is to find (or create) a dataset of faces that can be used to train/test the neural network.</p>
<p>I want to touch on the section where he talks about ethical issues. I agree that there might not be obvious ethical issues other than one particular implication and that depends entirely on the dataset he chooses to use. If its a dataset of real human faces, then there could be an ethical implication around that. I would agree with the on going debate of ethical issues in regards to the potential effects on future society. I also would agree with his statement of the movie <em>ex-machina</em> being thought provoking, but I view the movie differently to him. He see’s it as “an excellent portrayal of how an uncontrollable female AI cyborg could replace humans in a future scenario”. My take from that movie was how a monopoly (blue book in this case) was collecting data (illegally if memory serves me right) and using it for a completely secret project around creating (general) artificial intelligence. This movie is great and terrifying because it portrays a very realistic image of what the tech giants we have today may be doing.</p>
