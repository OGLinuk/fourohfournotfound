			<p>It has been almost 3 years since I made the the switch to Linux, and have enjoyed every moment. Like most, I found the terminal to be a daunting thing at first, much like Linux itself. I quickly discovered how much more I enjoyed using a terminal over GUI applications. Though I have gotten by over the past years with the basic commands like <code>cd</code> or <code>rm</code>, I never really dedicated time to improving my skills with the command line.</p>
<p>This is going to be the first of many blogs aimed to record my learnings and discoveries with the Linux shell. Before I go any further I just want to stop and take a moment to recognize the many who have contributed to projects that have shaped the world as we know it today. Thank you. You are amazing and I will forever remember what you have done for not only me but all of those who use the things you have helped create.</p>
<p>One of those wonderful humans is <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org">William Shotts</a>, who is the author of the book <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php">The Linux Command Line</a>. This is a freely available book (in pdf form) under the Creative Commons Attribution-Noncommercial-No De-rivative Works 3.0 license. If you ever read this blog William, thank you.</p>
<p>Now I can’t think of a better reason to learn the shell than the one that William gives on his website.</p>
<p>"A few years ago we had a problem where I used to work. There was a shared drive on one of our file servers that kept getting full. I won’t mention that this legacy operating system did not support user quotas; that’s another story. But the server kept getting full and it stopped people from working. One of our software engineers spent the better part of a day writing a C++ program that would look through all the user’s directories and add up the space they were using and make a listing of the results. Since I was forced to use the legacy OS while I was on the job, I installed a Linux-like command line environment for it. When I heard about the problem, I realized I could do all the work this engineer had done with this single line:</p>
<p><code>du -s * | sort -nr &gt; $HOME/user_space_report.txt</code>." <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php">[source]</a></p>
<p>Not only did this make me laugh, but this also made me realize just how <em>powerful</em> the shell can be. Lets take this command as the first to deconstruct and understand. <code>man du</code> shows that the <code>du</code> command is used to summarize the disk usage of a set of files, recursively for directories. The <code>-s</code> flag is to display only a total for each argument, which in this case is the wildcard <code>*</code>. The <code>|</code> means that we pipe the output of the first command to the command that follows after the <code>|</code>. <code>man sort</code> shows that <code>sort</code> is used to write the sorted concatenation of all file(s) to standard output. The <code>n</code> flag is to compare according to string numerical value, and the <code>r</code> flag is to reverse the result of the comparisons. The result of those two commands are then redirected via <code>&gt;</code> to a file called <code>user_space_report.txt</code>.</p>
<p>Truly amazing.</p>
