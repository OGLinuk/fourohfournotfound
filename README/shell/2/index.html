			<p>Chapter 2 of <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php">The Linux Command Line</a> covers <em>navigation</em>. The commands explored in this chapter are <code>pwd</code> (print working directory), <code>cd</code> (change directory), and <code>ls</code> (list directory contents). I use <code>cd</code> and <code>ls</code> daily, but I donâ€™t often use <code>pwd</code>. The structure of the Linux filesystem follows the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard"><em>Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)</em></a>, meaning the filesystem is organized in a tree-like form of <em>directories</em>, which can contain files and other directories. The very base directory is called the <em>root directory</em>.</p>
<p>When working in the terminal emulator, we are always in a directory (usually somewhere in the <em>home</em> directory). This is called the <em>current working directory</em>. The current working directory can be viewed using the <em>print working directory</em> or <code>pwd</code> command. The contents of the current working directory can be viewed by using the <em>list directory contents</em> or <code>ls</code> command. An important note to remember about the <code>ls</code> command is that it is able to be used on <em>any</em> directory, not just the current working directory. To change the current working directory we use the <em>change directory</em> or <code>cd</code> command. The <code>cd</code> command is followed by the path to the target directory that you are wanting to change to. You can specify paths one of two ways; <em>relative</em> or <em>absolute</em>.</p>
<p><em>Relative</em> paths are just as the name suggests, pathnames that are <em>relative to the current working directory</em>. When working with relative paths there are two special notations that can be used to assist the pathing; <code>.</code> and <code>..</code>. The <code>.</code> notation refers to the current working directory, and the <code>..</code> notation refers to the <em>parent directory</em>. <em>Absolute</em> paths are pathnames to a location <em>regardless of the current working directory</em>. An absolute path starts with the root directory and follows the layout until the desired directory is reached. An example of an absolute path looks like <code>/etc/systemd/system</code>, where <code>system</code> would be the destination directory.</p>
<p>Some important things to remember are first that <em>names are case sensitive</em> in Linux, so <code>/home/Desktop</code> will be a completely different directory than <code>/home/desktop</code>. Likewise with files, <code>hello.txt</code> will be a different file than <code>Hello.txt</code>. Second there are hidden files and directory that start with a <code>.</code>, such as <code>~/.ssh/</code> or <code>~/.bashrc</code>. Third Linux supports filenames and directories with spaces, but please <em>never embed spaces in names</em>. Save your sanity. Instead I suggest using an underscore or hyphen.</p>
<p>Something that I learned from this chapter is <code>cd -</code>, which changes to the previous working directory. <em>Epic</em>.</p>
