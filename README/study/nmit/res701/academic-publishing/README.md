Today's blog is about finding two academic research papers of my choice, which as stated in the [first res701 blog](/study/nmit/res701/hello-res701) will be around data science, machine learning, or deep learning. I stumbled across a gentleman by the name of [Jürgen Schmidhuber](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) when watching a video on a panel of specialists talking about the current state of AI. At the time I had no clue who he was or what his accomplishments were, but came to know that he was behind the publication of [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) (long short-term memory) architectures and also the advancements in [CNN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) (convolutional neural networks) architectures. "Since age 15 or so, the main goal of professor Jürgen Schmidhuber has been to build a self-improving Artificial Intelligence (AI) smarter than himself, then retire." [[source]](http://people.idsia.ch/~juergen/) These forms of AI are called [*Gödel machines*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del_machine).

I have two primary interests in the fields of data science, machine learning, and deep learning. [Meta learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meta_learning) and [metamodeling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamodeling). I do also have a fascination with [GANs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network) (generative adversarial networks), but thats because I hope to one day be able to procedurally generate shows like Rick & Morty (shout out to Justin Roiland and Dan Harmon with the hope of letting me do so without infringing on copyright). Another reason I have a fascination with GANs is my suspicion that they can/will be used to generate *very* realistic incriminating data, which is ironic since the wiki has recently added a section at the bottom called [*concerns*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_adversarial_network#Concerns). I have had this theory since learning about GANs back in 2017, but the recent website ['this person does not exist'](https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/) has shown that this is indeed *possible*. 

Enough doom and gloom though, time to get into the invigorating stuff! We dont actually have to *review* the papers that we choose, but rather answer a set of questions regarding the papers. The questions are as follows.

* Title and author(s) of the article

* APA reference

* How you found the article and what keywords you used

* What kind of article is it, (journal paper, conference paper, masters thesis...)

* All the reasons that you think it is an academic article

* How well it fits the 'structure of an academic article'

* How many references it has

* How many citations it has (if you can find out)

* For articles that you found online, the url of the article

* Say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not w/ reasoning

### Paper 1

#### Title and author(s)

*Gödel Machines: Self-Referential Universal Problem Solvers Making Provably Optimal Self-Improvements*

By *Jürgen Schmidhuber*


\


#### APA reference

"Schmidhuber, J. (2007). Gödel machines: Fully self-referential optimal universal self-improvers. In Artificial general intelligence (pp. 199-226). Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg."


\


#### How you found the article and what keywords you used 

I found the article via google scholar and the search used was *godel machine juergen schmidhuber*


\


#### What kind of article it is?

The article is an academic research paper


\


#### All the reasons that you think it is an academic article

The primary reason I believe it is an academic article is because of where it is published ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)). Most academic papers that I have come across have been published on arXiv, so I believe the site to be a credible source. Jürgen Schmidhuber is also the co-director of Dalle Molle Institute for Artificial Intelligence Research, a research institution in Switzerland.


\


#### How well it fits the 'structure of an academic article'

Perfectly


\


#### How many references it has

63


\


#### How many citations it has

\


#### For articles that you found online, the url of the article

https://arxiv.org/pdf/cs/0309048.pdf


\


#### Say whether you are interested in properly reading the article or not w/ reasoning

See the above paragraph on my two primary interests


\

The primary reason I believe it is an academic article is because of where it is published ([arXiv](https://arxiv.org/)).
