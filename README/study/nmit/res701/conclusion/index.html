			<p>Well it has come to that time. It’s near the end of the semester and it’s time to write the final blog. This blog is a reflection of the res701 class. To be honest of all the classes, res701 is one of my favorites. There were a lot of things that made me think and made me question more than usual. Especially the day when we discussed <em>knowing</em> and <em>knowledge</em>. Really made me question the foundation of things. Along with that it also made me realize just how interesting academic papers can be and how to deconstruct them.</p>
<p>My favorite class discussion was around <a href="/post/res701-6">interests</a>. This is because it made me reflect on what really interested me at this current point in my life and career. It also made me think about a topic I’ve always thought about, but never really put <em>much</em> thought into. Though it kinda made me terrified for the near future, it also inspired me to work towards preventing or making society aware of that very real and dangerous future. I would have to say a close second was the class around <a href="/post/res701-1">epistemology and ontology</a>.</p>
<p>My favorite assessment would definitely have to be the second one as I took the opprotunity to review an academic article that I had no previous knowledge in and was completely lost in terms of the jargon used and the subject. It was overall very fun to deconstruct and extract information out of. From this assessment I have learned how to read and understand academic articles to a better degree, as well as be able to find information that would relate to a research topic.</p>
<p>I would like to say thanks to my tutor Lars, who did an amazing job teaching the res701 class.</p>
