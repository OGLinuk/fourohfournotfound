			<p>If you are using a debian based Linux distribution like I am, then the shell you are using whats called <em>BASH</em> or “Bourne Again SHell”, which is a GNU project created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Fox_(computer_programmer)">Brian Fox</a>. Another amazing human being. If you ever happen to read this blog Brian, thank you. To interact with the shell we use another program called a <em>terminal emulator</em>, which in my case is <a href="https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty">alacritty</a> (thanks to <a href="https://gitlab.com/rwxrob">rwxrob</a> for showing me and the 276 current people working on it). To open the terminal emulator you can use the shortcut <code>ctrl + alt + t</code>. An interesting note that the book makes is that if the last character of the shell prompt is a <code>#</code> sign rather than a <code>$</code> sign, then the session has <em>superuser</em> privileges. Only two pages into the first chapter and already learning something new.</p>
<p>If we have already typed commands into the shell prompt then we will have access to the <em>command history</em> which is accessible via the up-arrow and down-arrow keys. The book states that even the mouse is capable of interacting with the terminal emulator via the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_Window_System">X Window System</a>. If you highlight text by holding down the left mouse button and dragging the mouse over it (or double clicking a word), it is copied into a buffer maintained by X. This can then be pasted with the middle mouse button. Wow. I’ve always used <code>ctrl + shift + c/v</code> with the highlighted text, I never realized it was copied when it’s highlighted, nor that you can paste with middle mouse button.</p>
<p>Now for some basic commands. The first is <code>date</code>, which as you might guess, displays the current datetime. The second is <code>cal</code> which displays a calendar. The third is <code>df</code> which shows the amount of free space on the disk drives. The fourth is <code>free</code> which displays the amount of free memory. Of these, the only one I knew about is <code>df</code>, which I use with the <code>-h</code> flag to make the output human readable. To end the terminal session you can either type <code>exit</code> or enter the shortcut (which I never knew about until now) <code>ctrl + d</code>.</p>
<p>I want to just give a tip to anyone who might be like me and be too eager to try things before reading something entirely. <strong><em>Don’t</em></strong>. Read the entire section before doing something or you will end up in panic mode like I just was cause I executed <code>ctrl + alt + f1</code> and entered into a virtual terminal without knowing how to get back to the graphical desktop (<code>alt + f7</code>). There are up to six virtual terminals accessible via <code>ctrl + alt + f1-6</code>.</p>
<p>Already learning so much and that was only from the first chapter!</p>
