			<p>If you’re like me then you use a terminal a <em>lot</em>. If you were me 20 minutes ago then you would also have multiple terminal tabs open with various applications running. I had heard of an application from some of my peers before about the ability to open multiple terminal panes within the same terminal window. For a while I didn’t look into it, but then (about 20 minutes ago) I had enough of swapping between terminal tabs and the editor I had been using (vscode). The software that I was told about was called screen, which is what is called a <em>terminal multiplexer</em>. After doing some research I found another terminal multiplexer (called tmux) that seemed to be a good contender to screen. I decided that I would try out tmux and see how it goes. With a quick and easy <code>sudo apt install tmux</code> the software was installed. The next thing to do is look for a cheatsheet, which after a quick search I found <a href="https://tmuxcheatsheet.com">one</a>.</p>
<p>I have to say, after using tmux for only about 10 - 15 minutes, I am already finding myself absolutely loving it. Not only do I feel more comfortable using Vim as my primary editor now, but I also feel more effective/productive. The commands for using tmux aren’t even that difficult. To start, we create a new tmux session, this is done by entering the command <code>tmux</code>. The next thing from here is either create a new window (which is done via <code>ctrl + b ~ c</code>) or split the pane (vertically -&gt; <code>ctrl + b ~ %</code> or horizontially -&gt; <code>ctrl + b ~ "</code>). To swap between windows, the command is <code>ctrl + b ~ n (for next) or p (for previous)</code>. To swap between panes, the command is <code>ctrl + b ~ arrow key direction</code>. For the icing on the cake there is an ability to <em>detach</em> from the session, which to explain in simple terms, it essentially suspends the session. To re-activate the session, simply enter the command <code>tmux attach</code>. One thing that tripped me up when using tmux was <em>scrolling</em>. A quick glance at the cheatsheet showed that you can scroll by entering copy mode (<code>ctrl + b ~ [</code>), then using the arrow keys.</p>
