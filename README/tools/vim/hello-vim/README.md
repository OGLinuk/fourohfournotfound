I was first introduced to [Vim](https://www.vim.org) by my good friend [Sam](https://github.com/pigeonhands). As someone who tries to work as much in the terminal as possible, Vim was perfect for my text editing needs. Although I've known/used Vim for a while, it's always basic usage for quick edititing, and its always been a secondary editor to Visual Studio Code. This was because I relied heavily on the intellisense when programming in langauges like Go. 

Today I read something that changed my perspective on intellisense. I've recently started watching a twitch streamer by the name of [rwxrob](https://twitch.tv/rwxrob), who replied to someone posting in his discord about the [Language Server Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_Server_Protocol). He stated that "intellisense and autocompletion are two of the most disasterously bad things adopted by modern developers and are only appreciated by those just beginning as a crutch that is better served by learning to search through syntax and documentation with examples instead. The end." 


Now I would like to also say that after talking with Rob, he did state that "I do have opinions but I'm happy to change them when I have new information. I'm a little softer on my position about tab completion over the popups from intellisense. The fact that I have become very fast at looking stuff up with [Lynx](https://linux.die.net/man/1/lynx) has also influenced my opinion on the matter. If I had to look up everything on a graphic browser I would probably like intellisense a lot more. I was raised on man pages and lynx and therefore am biased."

This has inspired me to properly learn Vim and ditch my reliance on intellisense.

Time to hit that `vimtutor`.
