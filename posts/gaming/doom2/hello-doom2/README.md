# Hello DOOM 2!

DOOM is the series that just keeps on giving... The same can be said for
[chocolate-doom](https://github.com/chocolate-doom/chocolate-doom) and
[gzdoom](/gaming/doom/gzdoom/). DOOM 2 is as easy to play as the original,
and whats better is you can use the same source ports. We will be using
[crispy-doom](https://github.com/fabiangreffath/crispy-doom) this time.
