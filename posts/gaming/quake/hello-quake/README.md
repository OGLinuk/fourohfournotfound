# Hello Quake!

Quake is another amazing creation of the guys at id software, and like the
DOOM games, very much alive to this day. I am unsure if anyone would have
thought that the Quake series would make such an impact and morph in so many
ways. One of my good friends at work introduced me to this
[xmas](https://www.moddb.com/mods/quake-xmas-jam-2019) compilation of community
made Quake maps.

There are a few source ports that we can choose from. One in particular I am
bias towards because it is capable of playing Quake 1, 2, and 3. We will be
using a more modern source port to enable us to utilize a GPU called
[`vkQuake`](https://github.com/Novum/vkQuake).

Once you have followed the steps to install dependencies and compile vkQuake,
you will need to obtain the [`.pk3` files](https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/PK3),
which you can get from places like GOG or steam. Find where the local game
files are stored and copy the `id1` directory to `vkQuake/Quake`.

To play run `./vkquake`.
