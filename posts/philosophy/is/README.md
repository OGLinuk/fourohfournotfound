# (What) Is

Philosophy is understanding. What is being understood is dependent
on the context. There are many contexts of philosophy. The philosophy of
life for example. Why should one care about understanding? What should
one understand? How can one come to understand what one does not?

Lets first propose a question: What is ones first thought? At first
one may be confused, but lets add to the question. What is the
context? Lets assume that the context is the first thought one currently
has. In that context, ones thought might be one of confusion. Ones
first thought might be one of enlightenment. One might still be
reflecting on which one is being referred to.

Now that one is thinking, lets ask another question. What is thinking?
This question may seem trivial, but really think about it. What does one
think?
