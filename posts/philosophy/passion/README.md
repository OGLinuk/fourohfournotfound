# Passion

Passion, according to the cambridge dictionary, is "a very powerful
feeling" or "a powerful emotion". How does one know when one has passion
for something? Is it when you get a thrill? Is it when you lay awake at
night because you cant stop thinking about the thing? Words escape how to
truly describe passion, simply because its only known to the individual.
I couldnt say when, but I realized at a young age that technology was
my passion. My earliest memories are playing games like Super Smash Bros
and 007 Golden Eye with my older brothers. As I grew older my passion for
technology only became more refined. In 2015 I made my first program,
which was a space-invaders game written in Visual Basic, which was the
result of a tutorial I followed on youtube. The feeling was
undescribable.
