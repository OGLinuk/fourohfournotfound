*The most difficult thing to do is to communicate.* Whether that form of
communication is verbal, digital, musical, poetical, artistical, or some
other form. There are some who are able to communicate in a way that
resonates with many. Alan Watts, Shakespeare, Mozart, Isaac Asimov, and
many others. How is unknown. Though I am not someone who cares to be
known, I am someone who wishes to pass on what I have learned from
personal experiences and from others. Posts are, in my view, one of the
best ways to do so. I find it hard to convey my thoughts into words which
are not only understandable, but are engaging. My posts are sporadic,
and I fail to complete most blogs that I start due to various reasons. My
life long goal is to continue to share, so that others may learn or
become inspired. Whether that is the case or not after reading my blogs is
up to the reader. If you're reading this, thank you. I may never know
you, but I sincerely appreciate you. Be the change that so many claim to
wish for.
