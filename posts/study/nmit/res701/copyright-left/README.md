# Copyright vs Copyleft

Todays class was around [creative commons](https://creativecommons.org/choose/), which is a permissive license designed as a better alternative to copyright. We were shown a [video](https://youtu.be/IeTybKL1pM4) which covered how copying is *not* stealing. Makes sense if you think about it. Copying is taking something and making a duplicate of it, where as stealing is taking something and leaving nothing. 


There is a website called [choosealicense](https://choosealicense.com/) which clearly describes the use cases/scenarios that a certain license would cover. An example of one of the licenses is the [GNU General Public License v3.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) which gives the following permissions. 

* Commercial use
* Distribution
* Modification
* Patent use
* Private use

with the conditions

* Disclose source
* License and copyright notice
* Same license 
* State changes

and the limitations

* Liability
* Warranty

This license according to the choosealicense site "lets people do almost anything they want with your project, except to distribute closed source versions." [[source]](https://choosealicense.com/)

Another example license is the [MIT license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) which according to the site "is short and to the point. It lets people do almost anything they want with your project, including to make and distribute closed source versions." [[source]](https://choosealicense.com/) It gives following permissions.

* Commercial use
* Distribution
* Modification
* Private use

with the conditions

* License and copyright notice

and the limitations

* Liability
* Warranty

There are plenty of other [licenses](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/) to checkout, each with their own set of permissions, conditions, and limitations. I encourage you to explore them and learn more about them if you are ever wanting to start a project or use/get involved with one. I also encourage you to watch an amazing, yet sad documentation on a person named Aaron Swartz called [The Internets Own Boy](https://archive.org/details/TheInternetsOwnBoyTheStoryOfAaronSwartz). Aaron Swartz played a big part in the push of creative commons and the world owes more to him than can ever be realized.
